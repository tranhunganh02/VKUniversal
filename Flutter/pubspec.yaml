# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
  - assets/
  - assets/images/
  - assets/images/background/
  - assets/images/background/vku_landscape.jpg
  - assets/images/logo/
  - assets/images/logo/vku.png
  - assets/images/logo/google_icon.jpg
  - assets/fonts/
  - assets/images/avatar/
  - assets/vectors/outline/
  - assets/vectors/outline/home_outline.svg
  - assets/vectors/solid/
  - assets/data/
  - assets/data/university_class.json
  - assets/data/major.json

  

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Montserrat
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/
  #       - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Medium.ttf
  #         weight: 500

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
